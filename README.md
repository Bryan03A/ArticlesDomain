## 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Catalog delete Service** (Python / Flask + MongoDB + gRPC)

- **üß† Purpose**:  
  Manages 3D model metadata stored in MongoDB. Allows only the **creator** of a model to delete it. When deleted by ID, it coordinates with a gRPC service to also remove the associated image.

- **üß™ Port**: `5011`

- **üß∞ Tech Stack**:
  - **Language**: Python  
  - **Framework**: Flask  
  - **Database Driver**: PyMongo  
  - **RPC**: gRPC (`protobuf` + `grpcio`)  
  - **Auth**: JWT with PyJWT  
  - **Config**: `python-dotenv` for environment variable management

- **üõ¢Ô∏è Database**:
  - **Type**: NoSQL  
  - **Engine**: MongoDB Atlas  
  - **Collection**: `models` ‚Äî stores 3D model documents (`_id`, `name`, `created_by`, etc.)

- **üîê Security**:
  - Uses Bearer token from the `Authorization` header
  - Decodes token using `SECRET_KEY` (from `.env`)
  - Only the **creator** (`username` in token) can delete a model (`created_by` in DB)
  - Token expiration (`exp`) verification is disabled ‚Äî enable for production

- **üì° Communication**:
  - **REST (JSON)**: public-facing endpoints  
  - **gRPC (internal)**: connects to `grpc-image-del-service:5014`  
    - Calls `DeleteImageByModelId(model_id)` to delete associated image on model deletion

- **üåç Endpoints**:
  - `GET /` ‚Äî Health check / welcome message  
  - `DELETE /models/<model_name>` ‚Äî Deletes a model by its name (owner only)  
  - `DELETE /models/id/<model_id>` ‚Äî Deletes by ID and triggers image deletion via gRPC

- **üé® Design Patterns**:
  - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Helpers are used to isolate JWT decoding and ownership validation  
  - **Dependency Inversion (basic)**: gRPC stub is abstracted through a configured channel

- **üèóÔ∏è Architecture**: Light N-layered structure
  - **Presentation Layer**: Flask routes + optional CORS  
  - **Integration Layer**: gRPC client for image operations  
  - **Data Access Layer**: Direct DB access via `models_collection`

- **üõ†Ô∏è Notes**:
  - Token decoding and ownership checks are printed to console for debugging  
  - CORS setup exists but is commented out ‚Äî configure properly in production  
  - Error handling is consistent using JSON responses and appropriate HTTP status codes

- **üß™ Port**: `5003`

- **üß∞ Tech Stack**:  
  - Language: Python  
  - Framework: Flask  
  - Database: MongoDB (via PyMongo)  
  - Auth: JWT (PyJWT)  
  - Config: python-dotenv for environment variables  
  - Optional CORS support (commented)

- **üõ¢Ô∏è Database**:  
  - Type: NoSQL document store  
  - Engine: MongoDB Atlas  
  - Collection: `models` (stores 3D model metadata with fields like `_id`, `name`, `created_by`, etc.)

- **üîê Security**:  
  - JWT token extracted from Authorization header (Bearer token)  
  - Token decoded with secret key, no expiration check (should be enabled in production)  
  - Ownership validation: only user matching `created_by` can update or delete the model  
  - Returns 401 if token is missing or invalid, 403 for unauthorized access

- **üì° Communication**: REST (JSON)  
  - Standard CRUD endpoints for models  
  - Clear JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes

- **üåç Endpoints**:

  | Endpoint                   | Method | Description                                   |
  |----------------------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------|
  | `/`                        | GET    | Health check, welcome message                 |
  | `/models`                  | POST   | Create a new model (requires valid JWT)      |
  | `/models`                  | GET    | Retrieve all models                           |
  | `/models/user/<user_id>`   | GET    | Retrieve all models created by specified user|
  | `/models/<model_name>`     | GET    | Retrieve model by name                         |

  | `/models/<model_name>`     | PUT    | Update model by name (owner only)             |
  | `/models/id/<model_id>`    | PUT    | Update model by ID (owner only)                |

- **üé® Design Pattern**:  
  - Single Responsibility: helpers isolate JWT decoding and ownership checking  
  - Consistent error handling and response formatting  
  - Separation of concerns: route handlers focus on HTTP layer, business rules enforced by token and DB checks

- **üèóÔ∏è Architecture**: 3-layer (N-layer) architecture  
  - Presentation Layer: Flask route handlers  
  - Domain Layer: Authorization logic & ownership validation helpers  
  - Data Access Layer: MongoDB collection operations via PyMongo

- **üõ†Ô∏è Notes**:  
  - ObjectIds are converted to strings before JSON serialization  
  - JWT expiration check is disabled (for dev/testing) ‚Äî should be enabled in prod  
  - CORS middleware is prepared but commented out, configure as needed  
  - Debug print statements present for token decoding and ownership verification  
  - Error handling returns JSON with error messages and HTTP status codes  
  - MongoDB connectivity checked at startup with ping command  
  - Designed for maintainability and clear traceability of ownership and permissions
